# PWA_assignment
This is my repository for PWA assignment for MCDA 5550.

Hi, I am Parth Tarak Vaidya, A00456020, MCDA Fall 2021 cohort, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, NS, Canada.

As per the instructions given in the repository: https://github.com/simonachkar/mcda5550-pwa/tree/main/assignment by Simon, I have prepared the assignment.
I have no experience in JavaScript or web development, so I have learned everything required for the assignment using lectures, tutorials and the repository: https://github.com/simonachkar/mcda5550-pwa/ shared by Simon Achkar.

As a result, some similarities in how I have developed my PWA might be observed as I followed references shared by Simon in the instructions for assignment. These were: https://https://github.com/simonachkar/mcda5550-pwa/tree/main/01-simple-pwa, https://github.com/simonachkar/mcda5550-pwa/tree/main/02-local-storage and https://github.com/simonachkar/mcda5550-pwa/tree/main/03-indexeddb.

The assignment instructions stated that if I set "Due Date" parameter as "Date" datatype instead of "Text", It would be counted towards 0.5 Bonus points. I have successfully achieved the required functionality. it can be observed in the files ./index.html amd ./script.js along with ./db.js

After creation of simple app, the next step was to create a gform for input, recieve input and store in the IndexedDB using Dexie.js I have downloaded dexie.js and dexie.js.map from dexie.org website in order to make the complete app being able to work offline.

The instructions stated that while creation of database in Dexie, if the new "id" field was set as auto increment, It would be considered for 0.5 Bonus points. I have successfully achieved the same in the file db.js and have implemented some logic in script.js to help that.

Finally, the last step was to create a fully featured PWA from the app using a "manifest.json" file and the service worker "sw.js" file. The finalized app after this step is a complete Progressive Web-App.

Thank you,
